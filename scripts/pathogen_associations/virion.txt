detection_csv

name	type	description
AssocID	number	Row number from current VIRION version
DetectionMethod	string	Four harmonized categories in descending order of strength of evidence: “Isolation/Observation,” “PCR/Sequencing,” “Antibodies,” and “Not specified”. In some cases where detection method is not available via metadata, source information is used as DetectionOriginal (e.g., “NCBI Nucleotide”).
DetectionOriginal	string	Method used for determing the presence of a virus as described in the original work
HostFlagID	boolean	Denotes the presence of possible uncertainty in host identification, which users may want to check before proceeding any further.
NCBIAccession	string	A unique identifier assigned to a record in sequence databases such as GenBank

VirusOriginal	string	Virus name from original dataset
Database	string	Source for the record. One of EID2, Shaw, HP3, GMPD2, PREDICT, OR GenBank
DatabaseVersion	string	For static data, a citation. For dynamic data (e.g. Genbank) the access URL and a time stamp

temporal_csv

name	type	description
AssocID	number	Row number from current VIRION version
PublicationYear	number	For literature derived records. PublicationYear provides the year the literature source was published, accessed either from the original database’s reference description or from scraping the PubMed database.
ReleaseYear	number	The year a given association was “released” in public information (EID2 and PREDICT) or a publicly deposited sample on GenBank. For PREDICT, all values are given as 2021, given the release of a static file at that time even though some findings may have been published or deposited in GenBank earlier. (This redundancy should be captured in overlap with GenBank and EID2.)
ReleaseMonth	number	The month a given association was “released” to the public
ReleaseDay	number	The day a given association was “released” to the public
CollectionYear	number	Reports the year of actual sample collection (GenBank and Predict)
CollectionMonth	number	Reports the month of actual sample collection (GenBank and Predict)
CollectionDay	number	Reports the day of actual sample collection (GenBank and Predict)
